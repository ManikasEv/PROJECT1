            <h1>1. I am registered in the intangible prescription and I received an SMS with an appointment which serves me. What should I do;</h1>
            <p>A vaccination code is mentioned in the SMS you received. To confirm the appointment you must in turn send an SMS to 13034 writing only this code. You will then receive a new SMS stating that the process has been completed successfully. The pre-booking appointment must be confirmed within 72 hours, otherwise it will expire.</p>

            <h1>2. I am registered in the intangible prescription and I received an SMS with an appointment which does not serve me. What should I do;            </h1>
            <p>You can change the appointment suggested to you either at emvolio.gov.gr, or at a pharmacy or KEP, with the same procedure described in the next question, ie with the procedure followed by those who were not registered in the intangible prescription.            </p>

            <h1>3. I belong to the population group that is currently vaccinated, I am not registered in the intangible prescription and I want to make a vaccination appointment. What should I do; </h1>
            <p>You have two ways: either to enter emvolio.gov.gr, or to go to a pharmacy or KEP.    </p>

            <h1>4. I belong to the population group that is currently being vaccinated, but it is not easy to go to KEP to make an appointment. Can a relative do it for me?</h1>
            <p>Yes, it is possible. In fact, it can be done without authorization, as long as the person who will do the procedure for you signs a responsible statement with the following content:
            </p>

            <h1>5. I belong to the population group that is currently vaccinated, registered in the intangible prescription and I did not receive an SMS. What should I do;            </h1>
            <p>What you need to do is check that you have been selected for the current phase of the vaccination. This is done in three ways: either at your pharmacy or KEP (with ID and AMKA), or at emvolio.gov.gr (with AMKA and AFM), or by sending an SMS to 13034 with your AMKA. If this is indeed a phone number issue, you can follow the appointment procedure described in the previous question.            </p>
        </div>
      
    
        <div class = con>
            <h1>6. Although I belong to the population group that is currently vaccinated, I did a priority test and it shows me not selected for vaccination. What should I do;            </h1>
            <p>You will need to log in to emvolio.gov.gr/aitisi and fill out the form that will appear - you will not be asked for Taxisnet codes. Your application will be reviewed by the relevant Committee and, if you did indeed have the right to be vaccinated during the current period, you will be informed on how to make an appointment. The application process can also be done at the KEP. Pay close attention to the contact details you provide, so that you can receive your response as soon as possible.           </p>
        </div>
        <div class = con>
            <h1>7. I belong to the population group that is being vaccinated at the moment and until today I had not registered in the intangible prescription. If I register now, will I receive an SMS?
            </h1>
            <p>Unfortunately, the pre-booking process for each population group is done only once, before the appointments for that group are opened. Therefore, if you are in the vaccinated population group at this time, intangible prescribing may be helpful for your prescriptions and referrals, but not to make a vaccination appointment. Therefore, you should follow the procedure for the unregistered.

            <h1>8. I have booked my appointment, but I want to change it. What should I do;
            </h1>
            <p>Appointments change as they close: either at emvolio.gov.gr, or at a pharmacy or KEP, in the same way as described before. Be aware that an appointment change can only be made twice and only if you request it at least 120 hours before the originally scheduled appointment.
            </p>

            <h1>9. I have booked my appointment, but I do not remember when it is. What should I do;
            </h1>
            <p>Initially, your appointment is scheduled to be reminded three times, via SMS to the number you have stated to us: the first three days before the appointment, the second on the eve of the appointment and the third at 7 am on the day of the appointment.

            </h1>
            <p>You must have your ID card with you and your draft AMKA and vaccination code. Printing of vaccination details is optional.

            <h1>11. I could not attend the appointment I had made. What should I do;
            </h1>
            <p>You will be able to book your new appointment in any of the ways described above, but 6 days must have passed since the date of the canceled appointment.

            <h1>12. Will I incur any costs for any stage of the process?
            </h1>
            <p>No. The whole process is completely free for the citizens - both the visit to the pharmacies, and the sending and receiving of SMS.

            <h1>14. What procedure will be used to vaccinate the population in our country?
            </h1>
            <p>Vaccinations of groups of the general population begin in January 2021. For the smooth implementation of this procedure, the following steps are followed:

                </h1>
                <p>
                    After receiving both doses of the vaccine, most people will be protected. It takes at least a week after the 2nd dose to develop immunity, which, according to current scientific data, is estimated to last for 6 to 8 months. There is a small chance that someone will catch it even if they have received the vaccine. This means that it is important to continue to follow safety measures until a larger part of the population is vaccinated.

            </h1>
            <p>All European citizens will be vaccinated free of charge. The cost of vaccination in our country is fully covered by the European Union and the Greek State.

            </h1>
            <p>Το Εθνικό Σύστημα Υγείας προσφέρει αρχικά το εμβόλιο για την COVID-19 στα άτομα που φροντίζουν την υγεία του πληθυσμού και σε αυτούς που κινδυνεύουν περισσότερο. Οι υγειονομικοί είναι η πρώτη ομάδα που θα εμβολιαστεί ώστε να προστατευτούν οι ίδιοι αλλά και να είναι σε θέση να φροντίσουν την υγεία του πληθυσμού. Ο εμβολιασμός έχει ήδη ξεκινήσει. Η σειρά με την οποία θα πραγματοποιηθεί το εμβόλιο στον πληθυσμό θα βασίζεται στις οδηγίες της Εθνικής Επιτροπής Εμβολιασμού.

            <h1>18. Will I be able to return to my previous lifestyle after being vaccinated?
            </h1>
            <p>It is estimated that a large percentage of the population (approximately 7 in 10) should be vaccinated first, until immunity develops in the community. Therefore, we must continue to adhere to protection measures with the same consistency, until a large part of the population is vaccinated.

            </h1>
            <p>So far, hundreds of thousands of people have received the COVID-19 vaccine without any serious side effects, other than the usual ones seen after vaccination. The vaccines that will be used in our country have been approved for their safety, quality and effectiveness by the competent international organizations, EMA (European Medicines Agency) and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and have been tested by the WHO ( World Health Organisation).

            <h1>20. Do vaccines cause side effects?
            </h1>
            <p>Any side effects may be mild and transient, such as hand pain at the injection site, fever, malaise, myalgias and headache. All of these symptoms go away quickly, usually within twenty-four hours.
