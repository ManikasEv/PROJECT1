        <a>Here are some instructions about how to use the sms properly</a>

            <h4>1.Citizens who are not registered in the intangible prescription</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="text2">
            The citizen can check if he belongs to some of the priority groups by sending to 13034 a text message (SMS) with the AMKA and his surname (AMKA blank Surname). Immediately, the citizen will receive a written message, informing him if he is entitled to vaccination based on the population prioritization of the national vaccination plan. Then, the citizen can enter the online vaccination platform COVID-19 (emvolio.gov.gr) to schedule his appointment.
        </div>
        <div class="text3">
            <h4>2.Citizens who have registered in the intangible prescription</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="text4">
            Citizens who have registered for the intangible prescription (via the ehealth.gov.gr platform), and if they become eligible for vaccination, will receive a text message (SMS) on their mobile phone from the number 13034, notifying them that it has been done before -book an appointment. The text message will indicate the Appointment Code, the date and time of vaccination and the recommended vaccination center. The closest available is pre-selected as the vaccination center based on the declared Postal Code.
            <br>
            
        The citizen has the opportunity to confirm or modify his pre-booked appointment within 120 hours. The confirmation of the pre-booked appointment can be done by the citizen in one of the following two ways:
        <br>
        <li>
        By sending the Appointment Code via text message (SMS) to 13034. In case the user does not enter the Appointment Code correctly (for example, due to a typo), he will receive a reply SMS informing him that the Appointment Code is incorrect.
        </li>

        <li>
            By entering the emvolio.gov.gr platform and confirming the pre-booked appointment.
        </li>
        <br>
        To modify his pre-booked appointment, the citizen enters the emvolio.gov.gr platform within 120 hours from the moment he received the informative SMS from the number 13034. There the citizen has the opportunity to see and modify as he prefers appointment according to availability per vaccination center and confirm it.
        <br>
        
Finally, in case the citizen does not confirm his appointment (with or without modification) within 120 hours the pre-booking is released and the citizen has the opportunity to later schedule a new appointment through the emvolio.gov.gr platform.
